[Workout Tracker](https://workout-tracker22.herokuapp.com/)

This is currently not working properly - working with my tutor to figure out why it is working locally but not on Heroku.

## Usage
Start by navigating to the website using the link above.

At start up, the user is either presented with their last workout or instructed to start a new one. The user can create a `new workout` routine or build on their previous workout with the `continue workout` button.  The user can track all of their workouts in a given day by adding more and more exercises. When the user is finished, they hit the `complete` button and it brings them back to the home page. 

The user can view their stats by pressing on the `dashboard` button.
